README.md

- Here is my "Personal Mock-Up of Danan-Thomas.com. 

- This is a simple site that will house my Info, Portfolio, and Contact page.

- At the top of the site, you'll find a navbar that will take the user to each of it's "pages". 

- On each page, the user can interact with the different "widgets" for each activity

- This page can be viewed in the standard "web" layout or "mobile"

- For a better explaination, please reference the screenshots in the /asset folder

-Thanks and have fun browsing Danan-Thomas.com
